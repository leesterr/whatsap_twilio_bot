# Whatsapp Bot made with flask and Twilio.

This project provide a tutorial for basic twilio and flask Whatsapp bot.
I have used other third party APIs to demonstrate the functionality of this basic app but you can add yours according to your needs.

First of all you need to clone this repository and install the requirements by running pip install -r requirements.txt. make sure you are in the virtual environment.
After you have installed the requirements, run whats_bot.py

Make sure you have activated your twilio sandbox before you run the bot, otherwise it will not work.
